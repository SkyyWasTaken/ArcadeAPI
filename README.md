# ArcadeAPI (no-arcade)
This is a (poorly) cut-down version of Arcade API created for the express reason of giving me access to scoreboard events for other mods. This version of the mod will be discontinued as soon as Arcade functionality is established. I will release updates to any of my mods to work with later versions of ArcadeAPI, provided there are incompatibilities between versions.
